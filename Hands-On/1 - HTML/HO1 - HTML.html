                <h1>Self Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello, I am Jose Miguel Escalona, a student of DLSU-Manila currently taking up and finishing my degree in 
                    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Specializing in Network and Information Security.      
                </p>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h1>Programming Experience</h1>
                I personally focus on the backend side of programming rather than the frontend side of it, with the reason being that computers
                are primarily responsible for the (potential) creation, manipulation, processing, and storage of data.
                <br><br>
                The list below is the list of markup/programming languages that I have experience in (in no particular knowledge level or time of experience):
                <ul>
                    <li>Python (specifically Python 3.7)</li>
                    <li>C/C++</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Javascript (more on backend)</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h1>Target Career Path</h1>
                I personally aim to focus amongst two fields of Computer Science/I.T. which will either be in Networking and/or Cyber Security, preferrably through bootcamps/training centers and not just through work experience.
                I am still open to work as a software engineer, but I do find it stressful at certain times (especially given the fact that I've been programming back in Grade 10).
                <br><br>
                I aim to be certified in networking (preferrably <strong>CCNA</strong> + CompTIA Network+ if I wanted to) 
                along with other potential associate and specialist certifications down the road. I am also looking into cloud certifications since it 
                is relatively connected to the specialization of my degree.
            </article>

                <h1>Other information about me:</h1>
                I am greatly interested in all things Japan as it is my dream country. It also serves as my primary source of inspiration in all things related
                to technliogy and invitation (even if by corporate accounts, they tend to be slow in adopting newly discovered technliogy on their business).
                <br><br>
                You may found a simple message down below that is written by yours truly in Japanese but I 
                do expect that it is not the proper way of the language as I haven't received any formal education in Japanese. I am currently however trying to learn on my
                own, through informal means such as by watching TV series, movies, VTubers, and anime, as well as reading some Japanese material here and there. I find the capability
                to be able to read, hear, and understand something in another language that not everyone is familiar with quite amazing. This of course is in line with what is written below in Japanese.

                <h2>日本語にメセージ</h2> 
                みんなごめんなさいもしも私の日本語を悪いです。😔<br>
